I'm a physics major at Grinnell College and I'm interested in the overlaps between engineering and social justice. 

Currently I'm an intern at Stanford University in the [Lentink Lab](http://lentinklab.stanford.edu/welcome/biological_inspiration), where I'm working on gliding robots based on birds. In the summer of 2018 I also worked at Oregon State University, working on improving consistency of robotic navigation in a simulated Ebola Treatment Unit.

During the year I work at the [Grinnell Maker Lab](grinnellmakerlab.org), a program through the [Wilson Center for Innovation and Leadership](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/centers-programs/wilson) at Grinnell College and the [Grinnell Area Arts Council](https://www.grinnellarts.org/). The Maker Lab is a community-oriented makerspace that serves both college students and the local community.
