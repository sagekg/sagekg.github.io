I'm a physics major at Grinnell College and I'm interested in the overlaps between engineering and social justice. 

Currently I'm an intern at Stanford University in the [Lentink Lab](http://lentinklab.stanford.edu/welcome/biological_inspiration), where I'm working on gliding robots based on birds.
